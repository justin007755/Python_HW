# Study Drills

# Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
# A: Completed as above

# Remember in Exercise 0 when you started python? Start python this way again and using the
# math operators, use Python as a calculator.
# A: Completed

# Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py file that does it.
# A: Completed

# Notice the math seems "wrong"? There are no fractions, only whole numbers. You need to use
# a "floating point" number, which is a number with a decimal point, as in 10.5, or 0.89, or even 3.0.
# A: Noted. Something different between Python2 and Python3

# Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate. 20.0 is floating point.
# A: See as below
